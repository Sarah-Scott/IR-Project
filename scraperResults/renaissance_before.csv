"Waitse nna ke dule mo go Beyonce. Wame ke yole wa bo “I was here”" "Jul 28, 2022"
"Crediting a person doesn’t pay the bills.  She should be paid for her musical contribution. And Beyoncé could have seem to that being done." "Jul 28, 2022"

"Y'all sure picking and choosing with this Kelis stuff while being mad at J Lo when she ALWAYS gave people their writing credits.  Mhmm.  No one sued her either like Beyoncé." "Jul 28, 2022"
"Beyonce is a business woman. Kelis is talking about nicities. Her feelings are valid, but you weren't needed for permission so you weren't included. Business is never personal." "Jul 28, 2022"

She's not even saying that Beyoncé needed her permission. She just wanted to be notified. I totally understand her indignation." "Jul 28, 2022"
"Beyoncé isn't obligated to contacted Kelis. That's simply a fact. The appropriate parties were contacted and the sample was cleared. I can see she's upset she didn't get a call, but at the end of the day, it wasn't necessity." "Jul 28, 2022"
"And to be honest, I don't think Beyoncé was all devious like ""Fuck that bitch, I don't owe her shit."" I think it was just an oversight on her part. So hopefully this can be mended. I trust that it will be." "Jul 28, 2022"

"Sorry, one thing about Beyoncé. She knows exactly what to do to place her in the current climate." "Jul 28, 2022"
"OMG she thought Beyonce would call her  the Queen don’t do that. LMAO. What Kelisah should have done is say thank you Beyonce for making me relevant for life. Maybe then Bey would have had her people send her some flowers. Who does her PR. Child this is a mess." "Jul 28, 2022"

@Beyonce
 !!!!!" "Jul 28, 2022"
"I’m vintage hive so maybe that’s why I can be honest when my fav pull something. Beyoncé knew better. A credit on the album does not dismiss all of the bull Pharrell has put Kelis through." "Jul 28, 2022"

"I love Kelis but the energy toward Beyoncé is crazy (and I’m not the biggest Beyoncé fan like that I support at minimum) Beyoncé ain’t need all that smoke. Now Pharrell and Chad & whoever else is involved in the stealing of Kelis publishing laid them out." "Jul 28, 2022"
"People who get celebrity disease from being a popular ytt  LMFAOOO I mean sure beyonce...  purr or whatever" "Jul 28, 2022"
"Beyoncé not gonna let you hit" "Jul 28, 2022"
"It’s deeper than getting paid. Like both Kelis & Beyoncé said, their artist & they’re sensitive about their shit. No artist appreciates when they art is being stolen from them" "Jul 28, 2022"
"Please just give up with Beyoncé fans they are truly at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to intelligence" "Jul 28, 2022"
"beyoncé dropping an album less than an hour after the magma episode is released. amara truly stays flopping" "Jul 28, 2022"
"It feels REALLY special to have shared the exact moment it dropped and to have LISTENED to it altogether guys. Thank you all SO much for this eve/early morn music party. 
@Beyonce
 flawless honey we are forever gagged. THANK YOU!!!!!! #RENAISSANCE" "Jul 28, 2022"
"There’s something very “old school” about Cuff It. It reminds me of Before I Let Go but on steroids. Also, that transition directly into Energy?

"a woman losing her creative rights is suddenly okay ? it better be just me, beyonce stans and bin laden in hell when I die" "Jul 28, 2022"
"Beyoncé credited kelis on a song that’s not even kelis. that’s courtesy bcuz Beyoncé knows every know the song to be kelis. sis kelis need to rest" "Jul 28, 2022"
"Nobody can ever say Beyoncé’s dropped an album full of stinkers tho. Stayed relevant and released consistently. 

Nobody should fix their mouths to compare the backflip man to her again." "Jul 28, 2022"
"I understand being mad at Pharrell, but I don’t see why she’s so upset at Beyoncé. Despite her not being given her credits on the original song, she’s still being given credits on the Bey song." "Jul 28, 2022"
"It’s sad because Beyoncé has also been about empowerment when she defended Lauryn Hill against BET, Taylor  Swift vs  Kanye, Donnie Mcclurkin at the Grammys, gave praise to Sheryl Lee Ralph for DG when no one else did, and so many other times behind the scenes." "Jul 28, 2022"

That was some wild potent crack" "Jul 28, 2022"
"There is no side to pick omg. Does Kelis have a true bone to pick, yes. The fact of the matter is did Beyonce steal from her, no. Guys plz " "Jul 28, 2022"
"Renaissance is Beyoncé at her most debauched - it's an incredibly fun and lively handbaggy. post-disco record and a true love letter to the ballroom scene and queer culture and it's icons (Donna Summer, Grace Jones, Madonna). #RENAISSANCE" "Jul 28, 2022"
"Beyoncé ALWAYS gets to #1 on Nigerian charts, never doubt it." "Jul 28, 2022"
"Idk how to explain it but there’s like so many different sections in each song on Renaissance like each song feels like different songs combined into one and it works SO well !! Beyoncé is such a genius" "Jul 28, 2022"
"No 1 in less than an hour ! So na so una like Beyoncé reach for this country ? una dey like form sha" "Jul 28, 2022"
"RENAISSANCE is the most revolutionary game changing album I've heard in a very long time. Beyoncé works at a level that is unattainable. No one can stop her!" "Jul 28, 2022"
"I already know THIS is why Kelis don’t like Beyoncé. Like it makes sense. She’s not bossy, she’s the boss started this whole beef! Let’s get to the ROOT." "Jul 28, 2022"
"Not every song on Renaissance is for me but I think what I appreciate most about Beyoncé is that she studies. Every time she approaches a new genre, you can tell she does so with a genuine appreciation for the artists that breathed life into it before her.

What a woman." "Jul 28, 2022"
"Stan twitter's responses to this just shows to me none of them are actually woke like they present themselves to be because ik there would already be cancellation parties if someone else did this but since it's beyonce it's totally ok and apparently kelis should be grateful" "Jul 28, 2022"
"Beyonce drips in jewels as she rides a holographic horse on cover of new album Renaissance" "Jul 28, 2022"
"“When rap singing is mentioned nobody thinks Kandi.” Exactly. That’s why I’m giving her her flowers, baby. That’s the point. 

I think you think I’m discrediting Beyoncé…I’d never. I’m giving Kandi her credit for *helping popularize the sound.* That’s it and that’s all!" "Jul 28, 2022"
